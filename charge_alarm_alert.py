# Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack
# or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid
# available in every Widget.

# Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument
# command) or with the method bind.

# Example (Hello, World):
# import tkinter
# from tkinter.constants import *
# tk = tkinter.Tk()
